This hack **IS** compatible with vanilla saves!


This is a fork of the [matching decompilation](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) at [PRET](https://github.com/pret).

This fork tries to maintain vanilla compatibility whenever possible. It doesn't increase the size of any save data structure or the object event structure.
